        My name is Casey Scarborough. I'm an application developer currently working at
        <a href="http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en.html" alt="Norfolk Southern" target="_blank">Norfolk Southern</a>.
        I finished my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Clayton State University in 2014, and am currently attending Georgia Institute of Technology for a master's in Computer Science. My passions are programming, solving problems, and learning new things, and I'm always on the lookout for projects to spend time working on.

        I am primarily a backend developer, with most of my experience being in Java. My current job
        focuses in web application development using Sencha frameworks and Java EE technologies.
