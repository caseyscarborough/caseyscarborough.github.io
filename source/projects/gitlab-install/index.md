This project contains scripts that will perform automated installation of [GitLab](http://gitlab.org) on your server. These scripts work best on a freshly installed system, with no additions.

## Supported Systems

These are currently the tested and supported systems.

* Ubuntu Server 12.04 64-Bit
* Ubuntu Server 13.04 64-Bit
* Debian 7.1 64-Bit

## Usage

For __Ubuntu Server 12.04 or 13.04 64-Bit__, issue the following commands. Ensure that you use the `-d` or `--domain-var` flags to specify your domain name, and `--mysql` or `--postgresql` to choose your database. PostgreSQL is the default, and is recommended.

```bash
# Download the script and make it executable
wget -O ~/ubuntu-server-12.04.sh https://raw.github.com/caseyscarborough/gitlab-install/master/ubuntu-server-12.04.sh
chmod u+x ~/ubuntu-server-12.04.sh

# Display the help menu
~/ubuntu-server-12.04.sh (-h OR --help)

# Run the script
sudo ~/ubuntu-server-12.04.sh -d gitlab.example.com (--mysql OR --postgresql)
```

> Note: Although this script is titled _ubuntu-server-12.04.sh_, it does in fact work on both 12.04 and 13.04.

For __Debian 7.1 64-Bit__, issue the following command _as the root user_, ensuring that you update the `DOMAIN_VAR` variable with your respective domain name. You'll also more than likely need to install `curl` with `apt-get install -y curl`.

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/caseyscarborough/gitlab-install/master/debian-7.1.sh | DOMAIN_VAR=gitlab.example.com bash
```
 
After the script runs, your installation of GitLab should be fully completed and ready to go. You can then navigate to the application using your server's domain name.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, the first thing to check is to make sure that each file got it's proper configuration added. Everything listed below should happen automatedly, but there is always a chance for error. The following are the files to check and what should be set:

#### /home/git/gitlab-shell/config.yml

This file should have the gitlab_url set to the URL of your GitLab instance (with a trailing slash).

```bash
  gitlab_url: "http://gitlab.example.com/"
```

#### /home/git/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml

This file should have the hostname set under the web server settings.

```bash
gitlab:
  ## Web server settings
  host: gitlab.example.com
  port: 80
```

#### /home/git/gitlab/config/database.yml

This file should have the gitlab user and password for the database configuration.

```bash
production:
  username: gitlab
  password: kenvo2i3j0239urlks
```

#### /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitlab

This file should have the server name in the virtual host set to your domain.

```bash
server {
  listen *:80;
  server_name gitlab.example.com;
  server_token off;
  root /home/git/gitlab/public;
}
```
