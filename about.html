    <h1>About</h1>
    <h4 class="meta">I'm an aspiring full stack web developer and application developer.</h4><br />
    <p>I'm a computer technician and aspiring application developer. I spend most of my time programming,
      bettering myself as a developer, and working to finish my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      I currently work in my University's technical support location, where I specialize in management
      of faculty and student equipment and software. My passions are programming, solving problems, and learning
      new things, and I'm always on the lookout for new projects to spend time working on.</p>
    <p>I primarily am a backend developer, with experience in languages such as Ruby, Python, Java, MySQL, PHP,
      C++, Javascript, and HTML. I am currently working to build my chops in user interface experience and
      front end development. I've built this site to get experience in these aspects of development,
      as well as to create a landing page of sorts for myself. You can see more of the projects I've
      worked on by visiting my portfolio page.</p>
